# Power BI Report

In this repository, I've uploaded a Power BI report I created of sales targets of a US-based retail company. To create this report, I used the dataset [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-datasets) listed under "Retail Analysis Sample". A few things I've tried to highlight in my report:

* This company has several locations, each with its own district manager. So I have listed out all the district managers and beside it, I have put a map of all locations of the company. When the user selects a manager, the map zooms into the store locations that they are in charge of.
* I've included a guage which compares Sales Revenue with the sales target. The data shows that the sales target has not yet been reached. 
* I've also included two multicolored tree maps which show the total units both last year and this year. This tree map is responsive, so if you click on a square, the report will change to give more information about the data in that square.

Note that the .pdf file is not responsive (because it is a static page) so the interactive components will not work. So to view the interactive components of the report, you should download the PowerBI file that I've uploaded to this repository!
